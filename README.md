## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
  1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    Vehicle length, ground clearance, and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance of variance to MPG. Vehicle weight and spoiler angle was responsible for a negligable amount     of change to MPG. 
  2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
    No, the slope is not considered to be zero, as multiple factors were seen to be correlated to the difference in MPG. 
  3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    This model does not predict MPG effectively, as multiple factors have a strong impact on MPG.
